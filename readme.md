# BEST PRACTICE
	1. Check if the data is of the specified expected type
	2. Standardize and simplify data input and output
	3. Version control of data
Â 
# Follow the principle
    The integrity of data cannot be sacrificed for convenience, which is a very dangerous path. 
    We must strictly adhere to, type, standardize input and output, and version control of data.
